	     vulnerability to perform malicious activies.

Zero day vulnerability - A vulnerability that just got published so are no security patches to it yet.

Black box - a way of learning and finding vulnerabilities without knowing the structure of the system.
	    This method does that by providing the program with lots of inputs and compares the output with the expected output.

White box - a way of learning and finding vulnerabilities using the structure of the system. 
   	    This method does that by reading and analyzing the code in order to find bugs.
